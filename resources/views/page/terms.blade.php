		<p>Brand NUE/Nuesse Health Services may change the price for the Paid subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Program Purchase, or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any pricing changes to you in advance, and if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. Subject to applicable law, you accept he new price by continuing to use the service after the price change takes effect.

			<li>If you sign up for a Trial, you agree that the Cooling-Off Period for the Paid Subscription for which you are receiving a Trial ends seven (7) days after the start of the Trial. If you don’t cancel the Paid Subscription before the Trial ends, you lose your right of withdrawal and authorize Brand NUE/Nuesse Health Services to automatically charge you the agreed price each moth until you cancel the Paid subscription.</li>
			<li>If you purchase a Paid Subscription with no Trial, you authorize Brand NUE/Nuesse Health Services to charge you automatically each month until you cancel. You agree that the Cooling-Off Period is available for seven (7) days after you purchase but is lost once you use the Brand NUE/Nuesse Health Services during that period. </li>
		</ul>
		<p class="mb-2">Cancellation and refund policies differ according to the payment term.</p>
		<p>If you purchased your subscription through a third party, please refer to any terms and conditions provided to you in connection with purchase.</p>
		<h2 class="mt-3">Monthly Subscriptions</h2>
		<p>When cancelling a monthly subscription, all future charges associated with future months of your subscription will be cancelled. You may notify us of your intent to cancel at any time; your cancellation will become effective at the end of your current monthly billing period. You will not receive a refund; however, your subscription access and/or delivery and accompanying subscriber benefits will continue for the remainder of the current monthly billing period.</p>

You will not receive a refund, prorated or otherwise, for the remainder of the annual term. However, your subscription access and/or delivery and accompanying subscriber benefits will continue for the remainder of the current annual billing period.</p>
		<p class="mt-3">In order to change or cancel your subscription please contact us using the information provided at the end of these Terms and Conditions.</p>
		<h2 class="mt-3">Termination</h2>

		<p>We may terminate or suspend Your access immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if You breach these Terms and Conditions.</p>
		<p>Upon termination, Your right to use the Service will cease immediately.</p>
		<h2 class="mt-3">Limitation of Liability</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its suppliers under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't purchased anything through the Service.</p>
		
		<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>
		
		<p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
		
		<p>Additionally, you understand that usage of this app and the app as a whole is not intended to treat you or anyone else’s particular medical conditions, the program does not offer medical advice, care, recommendations, or treatment, and further that the program’s staff and employees are not providing medical care. If you are currently being treated for a medical condition, please continue to coordinate care with your physician. You understand it is your responsibility to direct any medical questions to your doctor before starting the program and/or using the app and you represent, as a condition to the start or continuation of this program that you have or will continue seeking medical advice from your doctor during the program’s duration. If you are unwilling or unable to continue seeking medical advice from your doctor during the program’s duration, you promise to notify the program staff immediately. If you are working with a physician to control diabetes, I represent that I have informed him or her about the program, prior to the start of the program, as some clients quickly need less medication to control blood sugars as they begin a healthy diet. I further understand and acknowledge, for the reasons set forth above, that participation in this program shall not be considered consent or an agreement on the part of Matthew Nuesse D.C. C.M.E., or any of the other program’s employees or staff, to provide me with medical advice, care, recommendations, or treatment.</p>
